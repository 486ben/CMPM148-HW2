<h1>In this assignment, I had collborate with Stephen Wei</h1>
In this assignment, I collaborated with Stephen Wei on our game. Since our game is a collaboration, our game has two stages(extra work).

<h1>Here is an overview of the roleplaying system:</h1>
On this page, we do explain the setting, the game mechanics, and the general objective of the game. 

<li>Stage 1: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6fl3hKEh10GAayVbzSybtukcO_OFF9T0N87DPGPd3M/edit?usp=sharing</li>
<li>Stage 2: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmTc6bKlaAGsHhJqmrHzoACPghSx64Mt8DrrgWQVo6E/edit?usp=sharing</li>

<h3>Discuss changes made after playtesting for:</h3> 
I found two roommates to playtest my game. 
<li> One roommate Henry says the stage 1 "Scenario Day" have too many. (At first, we have ten stories), he says having too many scenario days will affect the game speed and increase the confusion.We decided to choose the 4 most easy scenarios.</li> 
<li>One roommate Eric says that stage 1 has a scenario every day, which slows the speed a lot. He suggests maybe 4 days/per scenario. With his suggest, Stephen and I decided to use 3 days/per scenario.</li>
<li>"Stage 2 is more easy than Stage 1", My friend from computer sciences class suggest me make some insteresting change in stage 2</li>

<h3> The relationships between human players and game materials:</h3> 
In this example, there are five human players (Player A, Player B, Player C, and Player D) and one game narrator. The game materials include character sheets, dice, and a game map. The picture shows that each player first has a goal: Find the treasure, but each player to the dice indicates that they use dice to determine the outcome of certain actions. while they try to find the treasure, players also need to find the resources. The resources are the same as important to treasure and could be traded for treasure.


<h3> Discuss the intended experience:</h3> 
we hoped players would feel surprised when playing the game. In some of the scenarios day, the game narrator will give random situations to the player. Players will need to decide their own way, but we make the choice solution "think outside the box". This might include an impossible end. but we want player emotions to feel like excitement, fear, or satisfaction, or it might involve a sense of exploration or discovery.
