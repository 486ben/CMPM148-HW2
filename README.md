<h1>In this assignment, I had collborate with Stephen Wei</h1>
In this assignment, I collaborated with Stephen Wei on our game. Since our game is a collaboration, our game has two stages(extra work).

<h1>Here is an overview of the roleplaying system:</h1>
On this page, we do explain the setting, the game mechanics, and the general objective of the game. 

<li>Stage 1: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6fl3hKEh10GAayVbzSybtukcO_OFF9T0N87DPGPd3M/edit?usp=sharing</li>
<li>Stage 2: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmTc6bKlaAGsHhJqmrHzoACPghSx64Mt8DrrgWQVo6E/edit?usp=sharing</li>

<h3>Discuss changes made after playtesting for stage 1:</h3> 
I found four roommates to playtest my game. 
<li> One roommate Henry says the stage 1 "Scenario Day" have too many. (At first, we have ten stories), he says having too many scenario days will affect the game speed and increase the confusion.We decided to choose the 4 most easy scenarios.</li> 
<li>One roommate Eric says that stage 1 has a scenario every day, which slows the speed a lot. He suggests maybe 4 days/per scenario. With his suggest, Stephen and I decided to use 3 days/per scenario.</li>
<li> One roommate Justin says the stage 1 dice game is super fun and doable. He suggests on stage 2, maybe I can use deck of cards: spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds. On that way, it make stage 1 and stage 2 unique! So I will use the deck of cards in stage 2.</li> 

<h3>Discuss changes made after playtesting for stage 2:</h3> 
Players: Diana, Bobby, and Min.
Diana enjoyed using her card skills to outsmart Bobby's and Min's treasure points and steal items from them.
Bobby dislikes the card because he think it based on how lucky you are, but he enjoys the way to sneak attack and he can also earn back the treasure point.
Min felt that the rule is clear, but itâ€™s so based on your lucky, he is the only one who get the four cards of the same suit.
Overall, the players enjoyed Stage 2 and felt that it was balanced and engaging. They suggested maybe adding more situations later because stage 2 should be more stimulating.



<h3> The relationships between human players and game materials:</h3> 
In this example, there are five human players (Player A, Player B, Player C, and Player D) and one game narrator. The game materials include character sheets, dice, and a game map. The picture shows that each player first has a goal: Find the treasure, but each player to the dice indicates that they use dice to determine the outcome of certain actions. while they try to find the treasure, players also need to find the resources. The resources are the same as important to treasure and could be traded for treasure.


<h3> Discuss the intended experience:</h3> 
we hoped players would feel surprised when playing the game. In some of the scenarios day, the game narrator will give random situations to the player. Players will need to decide their own way, but we make the choice solution "think outside the box". This might include an impossible end. but we want player emotions to feel like excitement, fear, or satisfaction, or it might involve a sense of exploration or discovery.
